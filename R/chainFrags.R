# chainFrags
#' Search of chain specific fragments
#'
#' Search of specific fragments that inform about the chains structure.
#'
#' @param coelfrags coeluting fragments for each candidate. Output of
#' \link{coelutingFrags}.
#' @param chainfrags character vector containing the fragmentation rules for
#' the chain fragments. If it is an empty vector, chains will be calculated based
#' on the difference between the precursor and the other chain. See details.
#' @param ppm m/z tolerance in ppm.
#' @param candidates candidates data frame. If any chain needs to be calculated
#' based on the difference between the precursor and the other chain, this
#' argument will be required. Output of \link{chainFrags}.
#' @param f known chains. If any chain needs to be calculated
#' based on the difference between the precursor and the other chain, this
#' argument will be required. Output of \link{chainFrags}.
#' @param dbs list of data bases required for the annotation. By default, dbs
#' contains the required data frames based on the default fragmentation rules.
#' If these rules are modified, dbs may need to be changed. If data bases have
#' been customized using \link{createLipidDB}, they also have to be modified
#' here.
#'
#' @details The chainfrags argument must contain the fragmentation rules
#' which inform about the chains structure. For example, in the case of PG
#' subclass, the chain in sn1 position is identified by the lysoPG as M-H
#' resulting from the loss of the FA chain of sn2; and the chain in sn2 position
#' is identified as the free FA chain as M-H. These two fragments need to be
#' searched in two different steps: in the fist step we will look for lysoPGs
#' coeluting with the precursor using chainfrags = c("lysopg_M-H");
#' then, we will look for FA chains using chainfrags = c("fa_M-H"). This
#' information can be combined later using \link{combineChains} function.
#'
#' To indicate the fragments to be searched, the class of lipid is writen
#' using the same names as the LipidMS databases without the "db" at the end
#' (i.e. pa, dg, lysopa, mg, CE, etc.), and the adduct has to be indicated as
#' it appears in the adductsTable, both parts separated by "_". In case some
#' chain needs to be searched based on a neutral loss, this can be defined using
#' "NL-" prefix, followed by the database and adduct. If this neutral loss
#' is employed to find the remaining chain, "cbdiff-" prefix allows to calculate
#' the difference in carbons and doubles bounds between the precursor and the
#' building block found. For example, "cbdiff-dg_M+H-H2O" will look for DG as
#' M+H-H2O and then, it will return the difference between their number of
#' carbons and double bounds and the ones from the precursor. Otherwise,
#' "NL-mg_M+H-H2O" will look for fragments coming from the loss of MGs.
#'
#' In case these fragments identified as losses from the precursors are going to
#' be employed for the intensity rules, this same prefix has to be added.
#'
#' If a chain is calculated based on the difference of total number of
#' carbons and double bounds between the precursor and a previously searched chain,
#' \code{chainfrags} argument must be a character vector c("") and candidates
#' data frame and chain fragments list must be provided.
#'
#' @return List of data frames with the chain fragments found.
